<b>On any given night in the United States, more than half a million people experience homelessness (National Alliance to End Homelessness).</b><br> 

The homelessness issues are critical but often overlooked. People experiencing homelessness face negative stigmas from others. In this project, we seek to apply visualization techniques to the study of the U.S. homeless population. The intent of our work is to provide inspirational data insights about homelessness to other citizens, organizations, and county/state officials. Understanding where homeless people are located can help address the problem. It is important to identify the places experiencing the greatest challenges.

Our visualization includes six main parts:
* Percentage of Homeless per Capita
* Percentage of Homeless per Capita Vs. Total Homeless
* Homeless of Veterans
* Unsheltered Homeless
* Unemployment Vs. Homelessness
* Fundings


<b>The data </b><br>

* Data on homelessness are based on annual point-in-time (PIT) counts conducted by Continuums of Care (CoCs) to estimate the number of people experiencing homelessness. This data is provided by the HUD Exchange ( https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hdx/pit-hic/).
* Rates of homelessness are a comparison of point-in-time counts to state population data from the Census Bureauâ€™s Population Estimates Program, accessed via the US Cencus (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).    
* The state unemployment rate data are from the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm").
* The federal funding data is provided from the Department of Health & Human Services (https://www.hhs.gov/programs/social-services/homelessness/resources/federal-links/index.html).
