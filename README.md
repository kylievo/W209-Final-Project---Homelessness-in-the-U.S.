<b>On any given night in the United States, more than half a million people experience homelessness (National Alliance to End Homelessness).</b><br> 

The homelessness issues are critical but often overlooked. People experiencing homelessness face negative stigmas from others. In this project, we seek to apply visualization techniques to the study of the U.S. homeless population. The intent of our work is to provide inspirational data insights about homelessness to other citizens, organizations, and county/state officials. Understanding where homeless people are located can help address the problem. It is important to identify the places experiencing the greatest challenges.

Our visualization includes six main parts:
* Percentage of Homeless per Capita
* Percentage Homeless per Capita V. Total Homeless
* Homeless of Veterans
* Unsheltered Homeless
* Unemployment Vs. Homelessness
* Fundings
